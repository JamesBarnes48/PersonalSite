      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>I'm an aspiring programmer and web developer doing my BSc in Computing Science at University of East Anglia in Norwich. Currently based near Great Yarmouth, I love all kinds of film, TV and games (of course I do, I am a student after all) as well as travelling to different places any chance I get.</p>
      <p>From Python to C, from SQL to ARM assembly code, I have had some experience working with plenty of different languages. That being said, I have most experience in:</p>
      <ul class="langList">
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I first learned to code in secondary school because I loved video games. Since then I have used many different languages and experienced a wealth of different aspects of computing in my time as a student. I keep an open mind and am always
          interested to learn new things.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>I also enjoy cooking whatever different things I can come up with or that I see online, there's no better incentive than being able to eat what you've made afterwards!</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="skill-image-left" src="images/tv.png" alt="">
        <h3>Film and Games</h3>
        <p>My favourite thing to do though is playing games and watching TV and films. If it's on a screen i'm probably going to like it!</p>

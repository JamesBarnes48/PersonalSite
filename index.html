      <h2 class="section-heading">Hello!</h2>
      <p>A chap with a particular affinity for all things digital. Hooked on Super Mario from a young age and a controller in my hand ever since.
         Equipped with a pop culture reference for any occasion and a connoisseur of the coffee break at the office. I am anything but your average software developer.</p>

      <h2 class="subheading"> What am I up to?</h2>
      <p>This fine website you see before you was first born at the end of my degree. Seems like a long time ago! </p>
      <p>After completing my BSc Computer Science and graduating with 2.1 honours at UEA I have enjoyed great opportunities in working as a Javascript developer at Darktrace where I remain today.
        I've had a chance to put my skills to practice as well as pick up a few new ones. I have finally learned how to use git properly for starters (about time I learned there are branches other than master!)
        as well as working with some more advanced tools you might encounter when working in industry and peer reviewing work done by others. With a bit of graft I've found myself reaping benefits!</p>
      <p>From Python to C, from SQL to ARM assembly code, I have had some experience working with plenty of different languages. While I may be a web developer, mainly I have most experience in:</p>

              <p>As my primary language I have spent the most time with Java. Throughout my degree Java has been the language I use most often by far and I have created lots of different projects in it.
                The object oriented nature of the language resonates with me and I am capable of creating large projects in it with a hierarchy of classes.
              </p>
              <p>Some of projects I have made in Java include:</p>

              <p>I am relatively new to C++, only starting learning it in late 2019, but after a few projects using it I am seeing the merits of it already. It is very similar to C# which I had experience
                using early on during my A-levels. I enjoyed using some of the features in standard, low-level C++ that you don't see many other places, but on the other end of the spectrum I have also used the OpenGL API
                which was insightful too. I am still a relatively new C++ programmer but my proficiency in it will only grow with time.</p>
                <p>Some C++ projects I have worked on include:</p>

              <p>First touching on web development in the first year of my degree, I gained a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript then to create a website for renting a fictional house.
                Since then I have returned to web development in the summer of 2020 to expand my knowledge of it and create websites as a passion project. In this time I have delved deeper
                into web development expanding my knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS, using the Bootstrap library, jQuery, DOM manipulation and more.

          <h3>Favourite Game?</h3>
          <p>Right now Chivalry 2 is all I can think of playing. I don't know what makes the game so addictive other than its just fun to play.
            So fluid, so easy to jump on a game and charge into battle with your battle axe. I've been playing it for over a year now and it's one 
            that I always end up going back to! Also helps that I've gotten fairly good at it now. If you see someone with a bowl cut 
            cleaving through the hordes and clutching a 1v3 through a mixture of blind luck and determination then you know who it is!

          <h3>Favourite dish?</h3>
          <p>Of course you go to the shop and get a frozen pizza when you really can't be bothered to cook anything properly. In my house though we like 
            to spruce these up with our own toppings. They're nice! So I thought why not take the next step up and make the whole pizza from scratch!
            Knead out your dough and put it in an oiled frying pan on the hob while you put on your sauce, cheese, toppings etc. This gives it a nice 
            crispy bottom before you put the pan under the grill. What do you get? The best pizza you've ever eaten.

          <h3>Favourite show?</h3>
          <p>Recently bought a subscription to Now TV after putting it off for so long. I missed the House of the Dragon hype 
            because I didn't want to fork out for another subscription service and it was indeed difficult. I have now realised 
            though that even though I pay for Netflix I don't actually watch anything on there. So I have got rid of Netflix and embraced
            Now TV where I am spoiled for choice! I have really been enjoying The Sopranos. An undeniable classic no matter who you ask. 
            The new The Last of Us show is immense though! What a great bit of television that is. Every episode is a masterclass.
